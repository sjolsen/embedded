\section*{Chapter 6}
\subsection*{What is the purpose of I/O on a board?}

\subsection*{List five categories of board I/O with two real-world examples under each category.}

\subsection*{What is the difference between serial and parallel I/O?}

\subsection*{Give a real-world I/O example of each.}

\subsection*{What is the difference between simplex, half-duplex, and full duplex transmission?}

\subsection*{Indicate which transmission scheme is shown in Figures 6-27a, b, and c.}

\subsection*{What is asynchronous transfer of serial data?}

\subsection*{Draw a diagram that describes how asynchronous transfer of serial data works.}

\subsection*{What is synchronous transfer of serial data?}

\subsection*{Draw and describe how synchronous transfer of serial data works.}

\subsection*{How can board I/O negatively impact a system's performance?}

\section*{Additional Questions}
\subsection[i]{Assume a CPU has pins connected to a AD7304 chip. The CPU will send {\ttfamily 0x7D} to channel C of the chip.}

\subsubsection*{What is in the data frame?}

\subsubsection*{What is the timing diagram for this transmission?}

\subsection[ii]{Assume two devices are using UART for communication. The sending device has a clock of \SI{9600}{\hertz} and sends data at \SI{9600}{\bit\per\second}. The receiving device has a clock of \SI{200}{\kilo\hertz} and uses a counter to generate a slower clock for receiving data. For example, the device lets the counter count from $0$ to $9$ periodically. Then, the device generates a clock of \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}. Assume the counter must be a multiple of $16$ due to the design inside the hardware. Hence, the receiving device can only generate a receiving clock close to \SI{9600}{\hertz}.}

\subsubsection*{Assume the receiving clock is faster than \SI{9600}{\hertz}. What is the maximum frame size (including all start and stop bits)?}
