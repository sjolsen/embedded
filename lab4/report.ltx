\section*{Introduction}
The task of this lab was to implement a light sensor which samples light levels every two seconds, displays the average of the samples gathered over the last six seconds, and sends the average to a base station connected to a computer.

I learned how to use the \lstinline{Read} interface and that AM radio communication requires the use of \lstinline{SplitControl}.

\section*{Implementation}
I used an array to keep a moving window of measurements, from which the average is computed on demand. Each firing of the timer, a measurement is added and the average is displayed and sent to the base station.

The components used and the way in which they are wired is:

The interfaces used were:
