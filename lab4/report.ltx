\section*{Introduction}
The task of this lab was to implement a light sensor which samples light levels every two seconds, displays the average of the samples gathered over the last six seconds, and sends the average to a base station connected to a computer.

I learned how to use the \lstinline{Read} interface and that AM radio communication requires the use of \lstinline{SplitControl}.
