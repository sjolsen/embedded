\maketitle

\section*{Chapter 8}
\subsection*{What is the difference between an architecture-specific device driver and a generic device driver?}

\subsubsection*{Give two examples of each.}

\subsection*{Define at least ten types of device drivers that would be needed based on the block diagram shown in Figure 8-47.}

\subsection*{List and describe five types of device driver functions.}

\subsection*{What are the three main types of interrupts?}

\subsubsection*{List examples in which each type is triggered.}

\subsection*{What is the difference between an auto-vectored and an interrupt-vectored scheme?}

\subsection*{Name and describe four examples of device driver functions that can be implemented for I/O.}

\section*{Additional Questions}
\subsection*{In ATmega128, assume a 32-bit integer $A$ is stored in {\tt r4:r7}, and another 32-bit integer $B$ is stored in {\tt r8:r11}.}
\subsubsection*{Make an AVR function that implements $C = A + B$. The function stores the return in {\tt r12:r15}.}

\subsubsection*{Make an AVR program that implements $A += B$. The program shall call the function $C = A + B$ for the computation.}

\subsection*{The MICAz mote has $\SI{4352}{\byte}$ of data RAM. Make an AVR function to clean the data memory. The function should complete the following steps:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Clean the {\tt SREG} register;
\item Set the stack pointer to the bottom of data RAM;
\item Clear the whole data RAM to $0$.
\end{itemize}
