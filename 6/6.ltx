\section*{Chapter 5}
\subsection*{What are the three most common schemes used to store and retrieve data in cache?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Write-through
\item Write-back
\item Write-around
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What is the difference between a cache hit and a cache miss?}
During an access to a memory location, a cache hit occurs if that location is mapped into cache; otherwise, a cache miss occurs.

\subsection*{Name and describe at least four cache swapping schemes.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal -- the mapping which will least soon be used is replaced on cache miss.
\item LRU -- the least recently used mapping is replaced on cache miss.
\item FIFO -- the least recently added mapping is replaced on cache miss.
\item NRU -- a mapping not used within some time limit is replaced on cache miss.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Chapter 9}
\subsection*{What is a kernel?}
A component that contains the main functionality of the OS.

\subsection*{Name and describe at least two functions of a kernel.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Process Management -- includes managing interrupts and error detection.
\item Memory Management -- includes allocation and protection of system memory.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{In general terms, what states can a task be in?}
A task can be ready, running, or blocked/waiting.

\subsection*{Give one example of an OS and its available states, including the state diagrams.}
vxWorks has nine states: ``STATE + I,'' ``READY,'' ``DELAY,'' ``SUSPEND,'' ``DELAY + S,'' ``PEND,'' ``PEND + S,'' ``PEND + T,'' and ``PEND + S + T:''

\subsection*{What is a real time operating system?}
An operating system in which tasks always meet scheduling deadlines and execution times are deterministic.

\subsection*{Give two examples of RTOSes.}

\begin{itemize}
\item vxWorks
\item Jbed
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Name and describe the most common OS intertask communication and synchronization mechanisms.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Memory Sharing -- processes communicate by reading from and writing to shared memory.
\item Message Passing -- processes communicate by sending messages to each other's message queues.
\item Signaling -- processes communicate by raising signals or interrupts in each other's execution contexts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What is segmentation?}
Segmentation is an addressing scheme which divides an address space into sets of addresses called {\it segments} which share accessibility information.

\subsection*{What are segment addresses made up of?}
Segment addresses are composed of a segment base and a segment offset.

\subsection*{What type of information can be found in a segment?}
Protection and accessibility information.
